[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://github.com/CosmicScale/PSBBN-Definitive-English-Patch/blob/main/LICENSE)  
This is the Definitive Project for Sony's "PlayStation Broadband Navigator" software (also known as BB Navigator or PSBBN) for the "PlayStation 2" (PS2) video game console.

PSBBN is official Sony software for the PlayStation 2, released exclusively in Japan. Introduced in 2002 as a replacement for the PS2’s OSD, it required both a hard drive and a network adapter to function. It added many new features:
- Launching games from the hard drive
- Accessing online channels
- Downloading full games, demos, videos, and pictures
- Ripping audio CDs and transferring music to MiniDisc recorders in the Music Channel
- Watching videos in the Movie Channel
- Transferring photos from a digital camera and viewing them in the Photo Channel

The **PSBBN Definitive Project** (formerly the PSBBN Definitive English Patch) began in 2023 as an English-language patch for PSBBN, but steadily expanded well beyond its original scope. The project aims to translate PSBBN from Japanese into multiple languages, introduce modern features, and make it a viable daily driver in 2026 and beyond.

You can find out more about the original PSBBN software on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Broadband_Navigator) and follow the development of this project on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CosmicScaleFactor).

- The **PlayStation BB Guide** has been updated to reflect the button swap and the relocation of the [Game Collection](#game-collection). A new section has been added covering the Online Channels. Numerous improvements to the English translation.
- Improves the update process. A USB drive and keyboard will not be required for future updates.

**`02-PSBBN-Installer.sh`:**
- You can now set a custom size for the [POPS](#popstarter) partition. Previously, it filled all remaining space after creating the music partition.

**`03-Game-Installer.sh`, `ps2iconmaker.sh` & `txt_to_icon_sys.py`:**

- Multi-disc PS1 games now support disc swapping without additional setup. A `DISCS.TXT` file is created for every multi-disc game. Multi-disc games also now share a [POPStarter Virtual Memory Card (VMC)](#virtual-memory-cards)
- [POPStarter VMC Groups](#virtual-memory-cards) for PS1 games: games that can interact with each other's save data now share a single VMC. For example, licenses earned in Gran Turismo can be transferred to Gran Turismo 2, and Metal Gear Solid’s Psycho Mantis can comment on other Konami games you've played.
- VMCs now display clearer titles in **Save Data Management** and **Browser 2.0** with custom icons for each game and group.
- The game installer now automatically generates HDD-OSD (Browser 2.0) icons if not found on the [HDD-OSD Icon Database](https://github.com/cosmicscale/hdd-osd-icon-database). If cover images for a game are available in the OPL Manager Art Database, a 3D icon for the game will be automatically generated. 3D icons are also created for VMCs when a game logo is available. All newly generated icons are automatically contributed to the HDD-OSD Icon Database, and missing icons are reported.
- Fixed a bug where incorrect publisher information could be displayed for `ELF` files

**`list-builder.py`:**

- Improved Game ID extraction for edge cases. Now handles non-standard IDs like `LSP99016.101` and PS1 games with non-standard `system.cnf` files.

**Neutrino Updated to Version 1.7.0**

- Full changelog for Neutrino can be found [here](https://github.com/rickgaiser/neutrino/releases/tag/v1.7.0)

</details>  

# Installation Guide
## Requirements
The **PSBBN Definitive Project** script is essential for unlocking all the new features exclusive to version 2.0 and above. The script requires a PC with an x86-64 or ARM64 processor.

It is **recommended** to use a **fat PS2 console with an expansion bay** (**SCPH-3000x to SCPH-500xx**) and an **official Sony Network Adapter**.

**[PSBBN does not support third party HDD Adapters](#known-issues)**. However, when **[installing HOSDMenu only](#install-hosdmenu-only)**, third party HDD adapters are supported.

When using an official Sony Network Adapter, I would highly recommend installing a **Kaico** or **BitFunx IDE to SATA Upgrade Kit**.

**PSBBN** is also compatible with the **PS2 Slim SCPH-700xx** model with an **[IDE Resurrector](https://gusse.in/shop/ps2-modding-parts/ide-resurrector-origami-v0-7-flex-cable-for-ps2-slim-spch700xx/)** or similar hardware mod, as well as **SCPH-10000 to SCPH-18000** models with an **official external HDD enclosure**. **[Additional setup is required for these consoles](#early-scph-10000–18000-and-slim-scph-700xx-consoles)**.

You will also need an HDD/SSD for your PS2 that is at least 32 GB, ideally between 256 GB and 2 TB. A SATA SSD is also highly recommended. The improved random access speed over a HDD really makes a big difference to the responsiveness of the PSBBN interface. To perform the installation, connect the HDD/SSD to your PC either directly via SATA or through a USB adapter.

## Installing on Linux
64-bit Debian-based distributions using `apt`, Arch-based distributions using `pacman`, and Fedora-based[*](#troubleshooting) distributions using `dnf` are supported. Nix-based systems are also supported via flakes. Recommended distributions are Linux Mint, Debian, and for Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi OS.

**The PSBBN Definitive Project is a rolling release. To get automatic updates and the latest bug fixes, you must install the scripts using `git clone`.**

Install git, for Debian-based distributions run:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/CosmicScale/PSBBN-Definitive-Project.git
```

You can then change to the `PSBBN-Definitive-Project` directory and run `PSBBN-Definitive-Patch.sh`:
```
cd PSBBN-Definitive-Project
./PSBBN-Definitive-Patch.sh
```
## Installing on Windows
The recommended way to install the **PSBBN Definitive Project** on Windows is by using the **PSBBN Launcher for Windows**. The **PSBBN Launcher for Windows** is compatible with Windows 10 and 11 Home editions; other editions may not be compatible. For a trouble-free experience, make sure Windows is fully up to date.

**Video Tutorial:**

[![PSBBN Launcher for Windows: Easy Install & Setup](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/981e4abc-10b0-49d2-8d52-3e19ea80650b)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5ZvJoW4oNw)

**Enabling Virtualization:**  
It may be necessary to enable SVM Mode (for AMD CPUs) or VT-x (for Intel CPUs) in your BIOS settings if it is not already enabled. Instructions on how to do this can be found [here](https://www.elevenforum.com/t/enable-or-disable-cpu-virtualization-in-uefi-bios-firmware-settings-on-windows-pc.4928/).

Download the **PSBBN Launcher for Windows [here](https://github.com/CosmicScale/PSBBN-Definitive-English-Patch/releases/download/latest/PSBBN-Launcher-For-Windows.ps1)**.

**Set the PowerShell Execution Policy:**  
Before running the script for the first time, you must change the execution policy in PowerShell:
1. Open a new PowerShell window from the **Start menu** by searching for **PowerShell** and select **Run as Administrator**.
2. Type the following command and press Enter:

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

**You are now ready to run the script:**  
Right-click on `PSBBN-Launcher-For-Windows.ps1` and select **Run with PowerShell**.

The script will:
- Automatically set up the **[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)**
- Prompt you to select the target drive for installing **[PSBBN and HOSDMenu](#install-psbbn-and-hosdmenu)**, and a folder on your PC’s internal drive for managing games and media
- Launch the **PSBBN Definitive Project** **[Main Menu](#main-menu)**

**Accessing the PSBBN Definitive Project Main Menu in the Future:**  
Simply right-click on `PSBBN-Launcher-For-Windows.ps1` and select **Run with PowerShell**

**NOTE:**  
It is normal for the selected drive to be unmounted in Windows while running the script. Always exit the **[PSBBN Definitive Project Main Menu](main-menu)** by pressing `q`. This ensures the drive is safely unmounted from WSL and returned to Windows. For USB drives, remember to also eject them from the Windows system tray before unplugging them.

If you experience any issues while running the **PSBBN Launcher for Windows**, see **[troubleshooting](#problems-running-the-script)**.

### Synchronize All Games and Apps
This option updates the contents of your PS2’s storage to match the `games` folder on your PC. Any new games or apps are copied over, and any that were removed from your PC are deleted from the console.

The script lets you set the location of the `games` folder on your PC. Simply place your files in the `games` folder: PS2 `ISO`, `ZSO` or `BIN/CUE` files go in the `CD` folder; `ISO` or `ZSO` files in the `DVD` folder; PS1 `VCD` or `BIN/CUE` files in the `POPS` folder; and `ELF` or [SAS-compliant](#save-application-system-sas) `PSU` files in the `APPS` folder.

To add or delete games and apps, just modify the contents of the `games` folder on your PC, then select **Synchronize All Games and Apps**.

### Add Additional Games and Apps
Alternatively, you can add PS2 games directly to the exFAT filesystem of your PS2 drive by placing `ISO` or `ZSO` files in the `CD` or `DVD` folders, and `ELF` or [SAS-compliant](#save-application-system-sas) `PSU` files in the `APPS` folder. PS1 `VCD` files can be placed in the `__.POPS` PFS filesystem.

Selecting **Add Additional Games and Apps** adds the new content to the [PSBBN Game Collection](#game-collection) and [HOSDMenu](#hosdmenu). Additionally, any new PS1 or PS2 games and apps found in the `games` folder on your PC will also be installed. As with syncing: PS2 `ISO`, `ZSO` or `BIN/CUE` files go in the `CD` folder; `ISO` or `ZSO` files in the `DVD` folder; PS1 `VCD` or `BIN/CUE` files in the `POPS` folder; and `ELF` or [SAS-compliant](#save-application-system-sas) `PSU` files in the `APPS` folder.

PS2 games and homebrew apps can be manually deleted from the exFAT filesystem on the PS2 drive, and PS1 games can be deleted from the `__.POPS` PFS filesystem. Selecting **Add Additional Games and Apps** will remove any deleted titles from the [PSBBN Game Collection](#game-collection) and [HOSDMenu](#hosdmenu).

**NOTE:** To use `ZSO` files, you must select [OPL](#open-ps2-loader-opl) as your game launcher. When using NHDDL, any `ZSO` files in your `games` folder or on the PS2 drive are decompressed into `ISO` files when installed.

## Install Media
Select **Install Media** from the main menu and you will be presented with the following option:
1. [Install Music](#install-music)
2. [Install Movies](#install-movies)

5. [Initialise Music Partition](#initialise-music-partition)

### Install Music
Install music for playback on the [PSBBN Music Channel](#music-channel). To use the Music Installer, you must be running **PSBBN Definitive Project version 3.00 or later**. If you have previously upgraded from a lower version, you must [Initialise the Music Partition](#initialise-music-partition) first.

Supported formats are `.mp3`, `.m4a`, `.flac` and `.ogg`. Each file’s metadata must include the album title and track number. Place your music files in the default `music` folder on your PC, or choose a custom location using [Set Media Location](#set-media-location), and place the files in the `music` subfolder.

### Install Movies
Install videos for playback on the [PSBBN Movie Channel](#movie-channel). To use the Movie Installer, you must be running **PSBBN Definitive Project version 3.00 or later**. Your PC must also have an x86 processor.

The Movie Installer supports `MP4`, `M4V`, `MKV`, `VOB`, and other popular formats, as well as the PlayStation 2 video formats `pss` and `psm`. Shorter movies are encoded with a higher bitrate than longer movies. For best results, limit movie length to 2 hours and 15 minutes; longer movies may encode poorly or fail to convert.

Place your video files in the default `movie` folder on your PC, or choose a custom location using [Set Media Location](#set-media-location), and place the files in the `movie` subfolder.

### Install Photos
Install images for viewing on the [PSBBN Photo Channel](#photo-channel). To use the Photo Installer, you must be running **PSBBN Definitive Project version 3.00 or later**.

Supported formats including `JPG`, `PNG`, `TIF`, `GIF`, `BMP`, and more. Place your image files in the default `photo` folder on your PC, or choose a custom location using [Set Media Location](#set-media-location), and place the files in the `photo` subfolder.

### Set Media Location
Set a custom location for your `media` folder. Music should be placed in a `music` subfolder, videos should be placed in a `movie` subfolder, and images should be placed in a `photo` subfolder.

### Initialise Music Partition
Erases all music data from **PSBBN** and resets the music database. Use this option if you have upgraded from a version of **PSBBN Definitive Project** lower than 3.00, in order to use the [Music Installer](#install-music). You can also use this option if you experience problems with the [Music Channel](#music-channel).

## Optional Extras
Select **Optional Extras** from the main menu and you will be presented with the following option:
1. [Install PS2 Linux](#install-ps2-linux)
2. [Reassign Cross and Circle Buttons](#reassign-cross-and-circle-buttons)
3. [Change Language](#change-language)
4. [Change Screen Settings](#change-screen-settings)
5. [Clear Art & Icon Cache](#clear-art--icon-cache)

### Install PS2 Linux
**NOTE: This feature is for PSBBN only.**  
PlayStation 2 Linux is an official kit from Sony that turned the PS2 into a Linux-based personal computer.  
The **Install PS2 Linux** option allows you to install or reinstall PS2 Linux. To install PS2 Linux, you must be running **PSBBN Definitive Project version 4.0.0 or later**.

To install PS2 Linux you need at least 3 GB of free space on your PS2 drive. During installation, you will be asked to set the size of your home directory (used for storing personal files and apps).

When reinstalling Linux:  
- If Linux came pre-installed with your version of the **PSBBN Definitive Project**, all PS2 Linux data will be erased, including your home directory.  
- If you installed or reinstalled Linux using this menu, only the system files will be reinstalled — your personal files in the home directory will not be affected.

**Notes:**  
- To launch PS2 Linux, power on your PS2 console, then hold the **○** button on the controller. PS2 Linux will then boot.  
- PS2 Linux requires a USB keyboard; a mouse is optional but recommended.  
- The `root` password is `password`. There is also a `ps2` user account with the password `password`.  
- To start a graphical interface, type `startx` at the command line.  
- Launching the **Dillo** web browser will open a mirror of the old official PS2 Linux website, where you can find a wide range of software to download and try.  

### Reassign Cross and Circle Buttons
This option lets you swap the functions of the **×** and **○** buttons on your controller. You can choose between the standard layout (**×** = enter, **○** = back) or the alternate layout (**○** = enter, **×** = back), depending on your preference.  

**NOTE: This feature applies to PSBBN only. It does not swap the button layout for the POPS in-game reset dialog when exiting a PS1 game, or HOSDMenu.**  

### Change Language
When **PSBBN** is installed, this option changes the system language of PSBBN. Select from English, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, French, and the original Japanese. More languages will be added with future updates. For Japanese users, it also downloads and installs the Japanese versions of the [Online Channels](#internet-channel).

For both **PSBBN** and [HOSDMenu](#hosdmenu) users, this option also updates the [POPS](#popstarter) in-game reset (IGR) message and the language preference used by the [Game Installer](#install-games-and-apps).

After changing the language, it is recommended that you rerun the [Game Installer](#install-games-and-apps) and select *Add Additional Games and Apps* to update game titles to your selected language. For PSBBN users, this will also update the PlayStation game manuals.

### Change Screen Settings
**NOTE: This feature is for PSBBN only.**  
**PSBBN** normally locks the screen system settings to **4:3**. This option allows you to change the screen setting. You can choose between **4:3**, **Full**, and **16:9**.

This setting is used by some games and [HOSDMenu](#hosdmenu). It does not change the aspect ratio of PSBBN itself.

### Clear Art & Icon Cache
This option removes all game artwork and icons that are stored locally on your PC. When you next run the game installer, it will scan your game collection, then download and apply fresh copies of the required artwork and icons.  

You might want to clear the cache if games display incorrect or low-quality artwork, as updated artwork may now be available.

If you select OPL as your game launcher when [installing games and apps](#install-games-and-apps), per-game settings assigned in OPL are reflected when launching games from the [PSBBN Game Collection](#game-collection) and [HOSDMenu](#hosdmenu).

## NHDDL
[NHDDL](https://github.com/pcm720/nhddl) is a launcher for [Neutrino](https://github.com/rickgaiser/neutrino), a small, fast, and modular PS2 device emulator. If you select NHDDL as your game launcher when [installing games and apps](#install-games-and-apps), per-game settings assigned in NHDDL are reflected when launching games from the [PSBBN Game Collection](#game-collection) and [HOSDMenu](#hosdmenu).

## POPStarter
**POPS** is an official Sony PS1 emulator for PS2, originally released exclusively in Japan as a way to distribute PS1 games over the internet to **PSBBN** users. **POPStarter** is a homebrew launcher for **POPS** that enables the emulator to play any PS1 game from internal and external drives.

When installing PS1 games, **[HugoPocked POPStarter fixes](https://www.psx-place.com/threads/hugopocked-fixes-for-popstarter.39750/)** are automatically downloaded and insatlled, improving compatibility with over 100 PS1 games.

Hotkey button combinations are supported for disc swapping and various other options:

| Hotkey               | Function                       |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| SELECT + START + L1  | Quit Game                      |
| SELECT + L2 + R2 + ✕ | Software Reset                 |

| SELECT + L2 + R2 + □ | Close PlayStation CD lid       |

Details on hotkeys can also be found in the **Manual** of each installed PS1 game. To access it, in the **[PSBBN Game Collection](#game-collection)**, press **△** then select **Manual**.

## Virtual Memory Cards
A **Virtual Memory Card (VMC)** allows you to store game progress on your PlayStation 2’s internal drive rather than on a standard Memory Card.

A **POPStarter VMC** is created for every PS1 game. These can be found in **PSBBN** under *Save Data Management*, as well as in [Browser 2.0](#hosdmenu), in the `POPS` folder.

When running the [Game Installer](#install-games-and-apps), you will be given the option to enable **VMCs** for all your PS2 games.

Both PS1 and PS2 games support **VMC Groups**, enabling certain games to share a VMC and access save data created by other titles. For example, *Metal Gear Solid’s* Psycho Mantis can comment on other Konami games you've played, and credits from Gran Turismo 3 can be transferred to Gran Turismo 4.

## Game ID
**Game ID** for the **Retro GEM**, **MemCard Pro 2**, and **SD2PSX** is fully supported when launching PS1 games, PS2 games, and homebrew apps from the [PSBBN Game Collection](#game-collection) and [HOSDMenu](#hosdmenu), as well as physical PS1 and PS2 game discs.

The **Retro GEM** is a digital to digital HDMI output upgrade for multiple consoles. **Retro GEM Game ID** allows the auto-switching of display profiles on a per-game basis. You can find out more about the Retro GEM on the [Pixel FX website](https://www.pixelfx.co/hdmi-retro-gem).

**MemCard Pro 2** and **SD2PSX** allow save games to be stored on an SD card, supporting multiple **Virtual Memory Cards (VMCs)** and many other features. The **Game ID** identifies which game is running, allowing each game to be assigned its own **VMC**, and automatically switching to the correct card when the game is launched. You can find out more about the **MemCard Pro 2** on the [8BitMods website](https://8bitmods.com/accessories/memcard-pro/) and the **SD2PSX** on the [SD2PSX website](https://sd2psx.net/)

## Exiting Games
- To quit PS1 games, press `L1 + SELECT + START`
- If you selected [OPL](#open-ps2-loader-opl) as your game launcher, to quit PS2 games, press `L1 + L2 + R1 + R2 + SELECT + START` and to power off the console press `L1 + L2 + L3 + R1 + R2 + R3`
- If you selected [NHDDL](#nhddl) as your game laucmher, you will not be able to use the in-game reset as Neutrino does not support this function

## Launching PS1 and PS2 Game Discs
When running PSBBN or [HOSDMenu](#hosdmenu), simply insert a game disc into the DVD drive. The game will boot and set the [Game ID](#game-id) on both the **Retro GEM** and **MemCard Pro/SD2PSX** accordingly.

For physical PlayStation (PS1) discs:
- Adjusts the PlayStation driver's video mode, if needed, to ensure imports play in the correct mode

For physical PlayStation 2 (PS2) discs:
- Applies automatic PS2 logo patching, allowing [MechaPwn](https://github.com/MechaResearch/MechaPwn) users to launch imports and master discs without skipping the PlayStation 2 logo or encountering a corrupted logo screen.

## Save Application System (SAS)
**Save Application System (SAS)** is a new standard for distributing homebrew applications for the PS2. All SAS-compliant apps are packaged in a `PSU` file and include icons and metadata, making it the recommended way to [install homebrew apps](#install-games-and-apps) on **PSBBN** and [HOSDMenu](#hosdmenu). You can download SAS compliant apps from the [PS2 Homebrew Store](https://ps2homebrewstore.com/).

## Internet Channel
On the **Internet Channel**, you can access archives of various publishers’ online channels, just as they appeared in the early 2000s. The channels have been translated into English (work in progress). If you have a Japanese install of PSBBN, you will have access to the original Japanese versions. To view these online channels, your PlayStation 2 system must be connected to the internet.
- Explore the online channels of various game publishers, including Sony, Hudson, EA, Konami, Capcom, Namco, KOEI, and Bandai.
- Download trailers for *Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence*, *Bomberman Online*, and more. Trailers can be downloaded from the **Konami Channel**, **BANDAI Entertainment World**, and the **HUDSON CHANNEL**. Downloaded trailers are saved to an album in the [Movie Channel](#movie-channel).
- Download artwork and screenshots from the **PlayStation® Now!** channel. Downloaded images are saved to an album in the [Photo Channel](#photo-channel).
- Play a number of classic games from the Hudson archive, including *Star Soldier*, *Milon’s Secret Castle*, and *Nuts & Milk*. Games can be played by selecting *PLAY GAMES* from the **HUDSON CHANNEL** main menu.

## Music Channel
The **Music Channel** allows you to play back music stored on your PS2's internal drive and create playlists. Music can be ripped directly on the PS2 from an audio CD, and installed using the [Music Installer](#install-music).

It also supports exporting music to a NetMD-compatible MiniDisc recorder. However, MiniDisc support is broken in the current version of the PSBBN Definitive Project. If you want to try the MiniDisc functionality, you can use a [legacy version of the PSBBN Definitive English Patch](#legacy-versions-of-the-psbbn-definitive-english-patch).

## Movie Channel
The **Movie Channel** allows you to play back movies stored on your PS2's internal drive, organise your movies, and create playlists. Movies can be downloaded from several of the [Online Channels](#internet-channel), and installed using the [Movie Installer](#install-movies).

## Photo Channel
The Photo Channel allows you to view photos stored on the PS2's internal drive or a FAT-formatted USB device (USB stick, digital camera, etc.). Photos can be imported from USB devices, and installed using the [Photo Installer](#install-photos). You can create albums and playlists of your photos. You can also download game artwork and screenshots from the [Online Channels](#internet-channel).

## OSDMenu MBR
Written by [pcm720](https://github.com/pcm720). This program is executed on every system boot and when an application is launched from **PSBBN**. It is a homebrew replacement for Sony’s original MBR program. It is responsible for initializing the hardware, as well as launching applications and game discs.

**OSDMenu MBR** comes with many advantages over the original implementation including support for launching ELFs by holding a gamepad button at startup, automatic PS2 logo patching when [launching PS2 game discs](#launching-ps1-and-ps2-game-discs), adjusting video modes when [launching imported PS1 game discs](#launching-ps1-and-ps2-game-discs), [Visual Game ID](#game-id) for the Retro GEM, modifying system settings, and launching games via [OPL](#open-ps2-loader-opl), [NHDDL](#nhddl), and [POPStarter](#popstarter).

The full readme can be found [here](https://github.com/pcm720/OSDMenu/blob/main/mbr/README.md).

## HOSDMenu
**HDD-OSD (Browser 2.0)** is an enhanced version of the PlayStation 2’s system menu (OSDSYS) that adds hard drive support, letting you manage software, save data, and launch games and apps directly from the HDD. **HOSDMenu**, written by [pcm720](https://github.com/pcm720), patches **HDD-OSD** and adds additional features, including:
- Support for larger drives — **HDD-OSD** was previously limited to 1 TB
- Launch homebrew apps directly from the **OSDSYS** menu
- Launch [SAS-compatible applications](#save-application-system-sas) from Memory Cards and from the internal drive in **Browser 2.0**
- Support for launching applications from MMCE, MX4SIO, UDPBD, iLink devices and APA- and exFAT-formatted HDDs
- [Launch PS1 and PS2 Game Discs](#launching-ps1-and-ps2-game-discs) with support for Game ID, MechaPwn, and built-in PS1VmodeNeg
- Integrated GSM for disc games and applications
- Support for 1080i and 480p
- And more — see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pcm720/OSDMenu) for full details

**HOSDMenu** is compatible with both the official Sony Network Adapter and 3rd-party HDD adapters. It can be installed alongside PSBBN or separately.

If installed alongside **PSBBN**, it can be launched from the [PSBBN Game Collection](#game-collection), via a [shortcut in the Navigator Menu](#game-collection), or by holding down the **×** while the console starts up. If only **HOSDMenu** was installed, it will autoboot.

Apps installed with the [Game Installer](#install-games-and-apps) will appear in the **OSDSYS menu**, allowing quick launching. Games will appear in the **Browser** represented by 3D icons modelled after the game case. [SAS compliant apps](#save-application-system-sas) downloaded from the [PS2 Homebrew Store](https://ps2homebrewstore.com/) will also appear in the **Browser** represented by unique icons. [POPStarter virtual memory cards](#virtual-memory-cards) also get unique icons.

Game and VMC icons are downloaded from, and contributed to, the [HDD-OSD Icon Database](https://github.com/CosmicScale/HDD-OSD-Icon-Database).  

## OSDMenu Configurator
A PlayStation 2 GUI application for editing [OSDMenu-related](osdmenu-mbr) config files. The application can be launched from the [PSBBN Game Collection](#game-collection) or [HOSDMenu](#hosdmenu).

It allows you to modify boot options, such as assigning an app to a button for quick launch at startup, setting the display modes for [HOSDMenu](#hosdmenu), enabling or disabling the **OSDSYS** custom menu, and much more.

You can find full details on the [OSDMenu Configurator GitHub page](https://github.com/pcm720/OSDMenu-Configurator).

## wLaunchELF_ISR
A fork of [wLaunchELF](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/wLaunchELF) written by [Matías Israelson](https://github.com/israpps). The version included with this project offers improved stability and adds support for exFAT on external drives and MMCE (SD card browsing on **MemCard Pro 2/SD2PSX**). More details about this fork can be found [here](https://israpps.github.io/projects/wlaunchelf-isr).

## APA-Jail

![APA-Jail Type-A2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c83dab7-f49f-4a77-b641-9f63d92c85e7)

**PSBBN** was originally limited to just 128 GB of usable storage. **APA-Jail** allows for just over 2 TB.  
**APA-Jail**, created and developed by [Berion](https://www.psx-place.com/resources/authors/berion.1431/), enables the PS2's APA partitions to coexist with an exFAT partition. Up to 128 GB of the HDD/SSD is reserved for APA partitions, while the remaining space (up to 2 TB) is formatted as exFAT. This setup allows **PSBBN** and [HOSDMenu](#hosdmenu) to be installed on the APA partitions, while PS2 games and homebrew can be installed on the exFAT partition.

[OSDMenu MBR](#osdmenu-mbr) resides in the `__mbr` partition and launches apps, and directs [Open PS2 Loader](#open-ps2-loader-opl) or [NHDDL](#nhddl) to launch specific PS2 games from the exFAT partition.

**Warning: Manually creating new APA partitions on your PS2 drive and exceeding the allocated space for APA will corrupt the drive.**

## Early (SCPH-10000–18000) and Slim (SCPH-700xx) Consoles
The **PSBBN Definitive Project** can be installed on PS2 Slim **SCPH-700xx** models with an [IDE Resurrector](https://gusse.in/shop/ps2-modding-parts/ide-resurrector-origami-v0-7-flex-cable-for-ps2-slim-spch700xx/) or similar hardware mod. Installing to a SD card is not supported, A SATA adapter must be used, such as the [iFlash-Sata v10](https://www.iflash.xyz/store/iflash-sata-v10/).

You must also download the [External HDD Drivers](https://israpps.github.io/FreeMcBoot-Installer/test/8_Downloads.html). Extract the files and place `hddload.irx`, `dev9.irx`, and `atad.irx` in the appropriate system folder for your region on an **official Sony PS2 Memory Card**:

| Region   | Folder Name   |
|----------|-------------- |
| Japanese | BIEXEC-SYSTEM |
| American | BAEXEC-SYSTEM |
| Asian 	 | BAEXEC-SYSTEM |
| European | BEEXEC-SYSTEM |
| Chinese  | BCEXEC-SYSTEM |

**SCPH-10000 to SCPH-18000** models with an official external HDD enclosure lack the ability to auto-boot without additional software. To launch PSBBN, it is recommend to use the **PlayStation 2 Basic Boot Loader (PS2BBL)**. [Install PS2BBL as a system update](https://israpps.github.io/PlayStation2-Basic-BootLoader/Downloads/) to your PS2 Memory Card. In the configuration file, set `LK_AUTO_E1` to `hdd0:/__system/p2lboot/osdboot.elf`.

# Troubleshooting

## Problems Running the Script
⚠️ **Known issue**: Installing on **Fedora** is currently problematic. It is recommended to use a Debian-based distribution or the [PSBBN Launcher for Windows](#installing-on-windows).

If you encounter problems running the **PSBBN Definitive Project** on your PC:
1. Make sure you are running the latest version of your operating system and that it is fully updated
2. Use a recommended OS. The **PSBBN Definitive Project** has been fully tested on:

- Windows 10 Home Edition
- Windows 11 Home Edition

If you are using the [PSBBN Launcher for Windows](#installing-on-windows) script and experience issues:
1. Open PowerShell as an administrator and run the following command:
```
wsl --unregister PSBBN
```
2. Download the latest version of the `PSBBN-Launcher-For-Windows.ps1` script [here](https://github.com/CosmicScale/PSBBN-Definitive-English-Patch/releases/download/latest/PSBBN-Launcher-For-Windows.ps1).
3. Make sure you have an active internet connection. If you are using a VPN, try disabling it
4. Run the `PSBBN-Launcher-For-Windows.ps1` script again

If you still encounter errors:
1. Connect the PS2 HDD or SSD directly to your PC using an internal SATA connection, or a USB port directly on the motherboard
2. Try installing to a different HDD or SSD, or try a different SATA to USB adapter

## Problems Launching PSBBN and HOSDMenu
When you connect the drive to your PS2 console and power it on, **PSBBN** or **[HOSDMenu](#hosdmenu)** should automatically launch.

If your console boots to the regular OSD or freezes, it means that your drive has not been recognised and you are experiencing a hardware issue. You should check the following:
1. If using **PSBBN**, make sure you are using an **official Sony Network Adapter**; 3rd-party adapters are not supported
2. Check that the connectors on the console and network/HDD adapter are clean and free of dust/debris
3. Ensure the network or HDD adapter and drive are securely connected to the console
4. If using a SATA mod, make sure it has been installed correctly
5. Try installing to a different HDD or SSD
6. Try using a different IDE converter or SATA mod
7. Try using a different official Sony Network Adapter or 3rd-party HDD adapter
8. Try a different PS2 console

## Problems Launching Games

If OPL freezes at startup, delete any existing OPL configuration files from your PS2 Memory Cards or connected USB devices.

To display the games list in OPL, adjust the following settings:
1. Settings > HDD (APA) Start Mode: Off
2. Settings > BDM Start Mode: Auto
3. Settings > BDM Devices > HDD (GPT/MBR): On
4. Settings > Save Changes

If games do not appear in the games list in [NHDDL](#nhddl) or [OPL](#open-ps2-loader-opl) (after modifying the OPL settings as described above), or fail to launch from the [PSBBN Game Collection](#game-collection) and [HOSDMenu](#HOSDMenu), try the following:

1. If you have a [mod chip](#known-issues), disable it
2. Remove all PS2 Memory Cards from your console
3. Check that the connectors on the console and network/HDD adapter are clean and free of dust/debris
4. Ensure the network/HDD adapter and drive are securely connected to the console
5. If using a SATA mod, make sure it has been installed correctly
6. Re-run the [Game Installer](#install-games-and-apps) and select the alternative game launcher ([OPL](#open-ps2-loader-opl)/[NHDDL](#nhddl))
7. Connect the PS2 HDD/SSD directly to your PC using an internal SATA connection or use a different USB adapter, then reinstall [PSBBN](#install-psbbn-and-hosdmenu) or [HOSDMenu](#install-hosdmenu-only)
8. Try using a different HDD/SSD and then reinstall [PSBBN](#install-psbbn-and-hosdmenu) or [HOSDMenu](#install-hosdmenu-only)
9. Try using a different IDE converter/SATA mod on your console
10. Try using a different official Sony Network Adapter or 3rd-party HDD adapter
11. Try a different PS2 console

# Known Issues
- Instances in feega where some Japanese text couldn't be translated due to it being hard-coded in an encrypted file. Atok software has not been translated.  
- MiniDisc support is broken as of patch version 2.10 and above. I hope to fix this in a future update  
- The default on-screen keyboard is set to Japanese. However, a US English on-screen keyboard has been added, though you’ll need to press the `SELECT` button multiple times to switch to it. There's a bug where spacebar doesn't work on the US English on-screen keyboard, but you can enter a space by pressing the **△** button on the controller instead.  
- The × and ○ button swap is only supported on DualShock 2 controllers
- Media buttons on the PS2 DVD Remote Control are only supported on SCPH-5000x consoles with a built-in IR receiver. The remote control can behave erratically if no controller is plugged into Controller Port 1.
- Music installed with the Music Installer is only playable if written to the first 3 GB of the music partition. Music ripped from audio CDs in the [Music Channel](#music-channel) is unaffected and can use the full capacity of the partition.
- PSBBN only supports dates up to the end of 2030. When setting the time and date, the year must be set to 2030 or below.  
- PSBBN will freeze when launching games/apps if a mod chip is active. To use PSBBN, mod chips must be disabled.  
- PSBBN will freeze at the "PlayStation 2" logo when booting, if a 3rd party, unofficial HDD adapter is used. **An official Sony Network Adapter is required**.
- exFAT partition cannot exceed 2 TB. When using a drive larger, remaining space beyond that will be unusable.
- **wLaunchELF** and other native PS2 apps cannot create APA partitions on the PS2 drive. New partitions should only be created using the version of **PFS Shell** included with this project.
- APA partitions must not be created beyond the space allocated for APA during PSBBN/HOSDMenu installation. Doing so will overwrite data on the exFAT partition.

**Installation Instructions**  
There are two ways to install this English patch:

1. **PS2 HDD RAW Image Install:** Use this method if you have access to a PC and a way to connect your PS2 HDD/SSD to your PC. This is the most straightforward option. All data on the HDD will be lost.

2. **Patch an existing PSBBN install:** Use this method if you already have an existing PSBBN install on your PlayStation 2 console. Also, follow these instructions to install future patch updates. No data will be lost.

**PS2 HDD RAW Image Install**  
What You Will Need:
- Any fat model PS2 console*
- An official Sony Network Adapter
- A compatible HDD or SSD (IDE or SATA with an adapter). The drive must be 120 GB or larger
- A way to connect the PS2 HDD to a PC
- 120 GB of free space on your PC to extract the files
- Disk imaging software

Installation Procedure:  
1. Download [PSBBN_English_Patched_v1.x.x_Image.7z](https://archive.org/download/playstation-broadband-navigator-psbbn-definitive-english-patch-v1.0/PSBBN_English_Patched_v1.2_Image.7z) and uncompress it.
`PSBBN_English_Patched_v1.x.x_HDD_RAW.img` is a raw PS2 disk image of the Japanese PlayStation BB Navigator Version 0.32 with the PlayStation Broadband Navigator (PSBBN) Definitive English Patch pre-installed.
2. To write this image to your PS2 HDD, you need disk imaging software. For Windows, I recommend using HDD Raw Copy ver. 1.10 portable. You can download it [here](https://hddguru.com/software/HDD-Raw-Copy-Tool/).

**Patch an existing PSBBN install**  
What You Will Need:
- Any fat model PS2 console*
- An official Sony Network Adapter
- A compatible HDD or SSD (IDE or SATA with an adapter)
- An existing install of PSBBN software 0.32 on your PS2 console
- A FreeMcBoot Memory Card
- A USB flash drive formatted as FAT32
- A USB keyboard

Installing the English Patch:  
1. Install the PSBBN software on your PS2 console if you haven't done so already. Either via a disk image or manually, see the section **Installing the Japanese PSBBN software** below for details on a manual install.
2. Download [PSBBN_English_Patch_Installer_v1.x.x.zip](https://archive.org/download/playstation-broadband-navigator-psbbn-definitive-english-patch-v1.0/PSBBN_English_Patch_Installer_v1.2.zip) and unzip it on your PC.
3. Copy the files `kloader3.0.elf`, `config.txt`, `xrvmlinux`, `xrinitfs_install.gz`, and `PSBBN_English.tar.gz` to the root of a FAT32 formatted USB flash drive.
4. Connect the USB flash drive and a USB keyboard to the USB ports on the front of your PS2 console.
5. Turn the PS2 console on with your FreeMcBoot Memory Card inserted and load wLaunchELF.
6. Load `kloader3.0.elf` from the USB flash drive.
7. Eventually, you will be presented with a login prompt:  
     Type `root` and press enter.  
     Type `install` and press enter.
8. When you see the text `INIT: no more processes left in this runlevel`, hold the standby button down until the console powers off.

Remove your FreeMcBoot Memory Card. Power the console on and enjoy PSBBN in full English!

**Installing the Japanese PSBBN software**  
There are a number of ways this can be achieved. On a Japanese PlayStation 2 console with an **official PSBBN installation disc**, or with **Sony Utility Discs Compilation 3**.

To install via **Sony Utility Discs Compilation 3** you will need a way to boot backup discs on your console, be that a mod chip or a swap disc. If you are lucky enough to have a **SCPH-500xx** series console you can use the **MechaPwn** softmod.

Installing with Sony Utility Discs Compilation 3  
Preparations:
1. Download the **Sony Utility Discs Compilation 3** ISO from the Internet Archive [here](https://archive.org/details/sony-utility-disc-compilation-v3).
2. **SCPH-500xx consoles only**: Patch the ISO with the [Master Disc Patcher](https://www.psx-place.com/threads/playstation-2-master-disc-patcher-for-mechapwn.36547/).
3. Burn this ISO to a writable DVD. I recommend using [ImgBurn](https://www.imgburn.com).
4. **SCPH-500xx consoles only**: MechaPwn your PS2 console with the latest release candidate, currently [MechaPwn 3.0 Release Candidate 4 (RC4)](https://github.com/MechaResearch/MechaPwn/releases/tag/3.00-rc4). It is important that you use a version of MechaPwn that does not change the **Model Name** of your console or it will break compatibility with the Kloader app, we use later in this guide. Currently the latest stable version is not compatible. More details about exactly what MechaPwn does and how to use it can be found [here](https://github.com/MechaResearch/MechaPwn).
5. Format the PS2 HDD. In wLaunchELF press the **○** button for **FileBrowser**, then select **MISC > HddManager**. Press `R1` to open the menu and select **Format**. When done, press **△** to exit.
6. Launch the **Sony Utility Discs Compilation 3** DVD on your console. **SCPH-500xx consoles only:** Insert your newly burnt **Sony Utility Discs Compilation 3** DVD into the DVD drive on your PS2 console. On the first screen of wLaunchELF, press the **○** button for **FileBrowser**, then select **MISC > PS2Disc**. The DVD will launch. On all other model consoles, launch the **Sony Utility Discs Compilation 3** DVD any way you can (e.g. Mod chip/Swap disc).
7. After the disc loads, select **HDD Utility Discs > PlayStation BB Navigator Version 0.32** from the menu to begin the installation.

Installation:  
There's an excellent guide [here](https://bungiefan.tripod.com/psbbninstall_01.html) that talks you through the Japanese install. Because we have already formatted the hard drive, during the install you will be presented with a [different screen](https://bungiefan.tripod.com/psbbninstall_02.html). It's important that you select the 3rd install option. This will install PSBBN without re-formatting the HDD. When the install is complete you will be instructed to remove the DVD, do so but also remove your FreeMcBoot Memory Card, before pressing the **○** button.

Network Settings:  
You will be asked to enter your network settings. Make sure your Ethernet cable is connected. Everything is still in Japanese, but it's relatively straightforward:
1. Press the **○** button on the first screen.
2. On the next screen, select the **bottom** option, "Do not use PPPoE" and press **○**.
3. On the next screen, select the **top** option, "Auto" for you IP address and press **○**.
4. On the next screen, select the **top** option, "Auto" for DNS settings and press **○**.
5. Press `right` on the d-pad to proceed to the next screen.
6. Select the **bottom** option, "Do not change router settings" and press **○**.
7. Finally, press **○** again to confirm your settings.

For your efforts you will be given a DNAS error. This is to be expected. We'll fix that next. Press **×** and feel free to explore your fresh install of the Japanese PSBBN.

Disable DNAS Authentication:  
1. Turn off the console and put your FreeMcBoot Memory Card back into a memory card slot.  
2. Turn the console on and load wLaunchELF.  
3. Go to **FileBrowser**. Navigate to `hdd0:/__contents/bn.conf/` and delete the file `default_isp.dat`. This will disable the DNAS checks.

**Please Note:** Before installing the English patch, you **must** power off your console to standby mode by holding the reset button. Failure to do so will cause issues with Kloader.

**Notes**  
\* Also compatible with the PS2 Slim SCPH-700xx models with an [IDE Resurrector](https://gusse.in/shop/ps2-modding-parts/ide-resurrector-origami-v0-7-flex-cable-for-ps2-slim-spch700xx/) or similar hardware mod. **PS2 HDD RAW Image Install** is not compatible with early model Japanese PS2 consoles (SCPH-10000, SCPH-15000 and SCPH-18000) that have an external HDD due to space limitations (unless the stock drive is replaced with a 120+ GB drive). When **patching an existing PSBBN install**, Kloader might have compatibility issues with early model Japanese PS2 consoles (SCPH-10000, SCPH-15000 and SCPH-18000).  
- Use OPL-Launcher to launch PS2 games from the Game Channel. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/OPL-Launcher).
- Lacks support for large HDDs, drives larger than 130 GB cannot be taken full advantage of. PSBBN can only see the first 130,999 MB of data on your HDD/SSD (as reported by wLaunchELF). If there is 131,000 MB or more on your HDD/SSD, PSBBN will fail to launch. Delete data so there is less than 131,000 MB used, and PSBBN will launch again. Be extra careful if you have installed via the **PS2 HDD RAW Image** on a drive larger than 120 GB, going over 130,999 MB will corrupt the drive.
- You may need to manually change the title of your "Favorite" folders if they were created before you **Patched an existing PSBBN install**.
