# PSBBN Definitive English Patch

This is the Definitive English Patch for Sony's "PlayStation Broadband Navigator" software (also known as BB Navigator or PSBBN) for the "PlayStation 2" (PS2) video game console.

PSBBN is official Sony software for the PlayStation 2, released exclusively in Japan. Introduced in 2002 as a replacement for the PS2’s OSD, it required both a hard drive and a network adapter to function. It added many new features:
- Launching games from the hard drive
- Accessing online channels
- Downloading full games, demos, videos, and pictures
- Ripping audio CDs and transferring music to MiniDisc recorders in the Music Channel
- Watching videos in the Movie Channel
- Transferring photos from a digital camera and viewing them in the Photo Channel

The aim of this project was to translate PSBBN from the original Japanese to English, add some modern features and make it a viable daily driver for use in 2025 and beyond.

You can find out more about the PSBBN software on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Broadband_Navigator) and on my [YouTube channle](https://www.youtube.com/@CosmicScaleFactor).

  - Dropped APA support in favor of loading [OPL](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/Open-PS2-Loader), [POPStarter](https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/Home), [Neutrino](https://github.com/rickgaiser/neutrino), and configuration files from the exFAT partition to speed up initialization.
  - Moved [BBNL](https://github.com/pcm720/bbnl) to the APA header to further improve loading times.
  - Removed dependency on renamed [POPStarter](https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/Home) ELF files to launch PS1 VCDs; [POPStarter](https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/Home) is now launched directly with a boot argument.
  - [NHDDL](https://github.com/pcm720/nhddl) now launches in ATA mode, improving startup time and avoiding potential error messages.

## New installation scripts

These scripts are essential for unlocking all the new features exclusive to version 2.0. They require a x86 Linux environment to run. If Linux is not installed on your PC, you can use a live Linux environment on a bootable USB drive or a virtual machine. Debian-based distributions using `apt`, Arch-based distributions using `pacman`, and Fedora-based distributions using `dnf` are supported. You will require a HDD/SSD for your PS2 that is larger than 200 GB, ideally 500 GB or larger. I highly recommend a SSD for better performance. You can connect the HDD/SSD to your PC either directly via SATA or using a USB adapter.

## Video Tutorial:

[![PSBBN Definitive English Patch 2.0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d60dc4ff-85f8-4fb4-8acb-201b063545b0)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHz0yKYybhk)

<span style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold;">It is highly recommended to install the scripts using the following command to enable automatic updates:</span>
```
git clone https://github.com/CosmicScale/PSBBN-Definitive-English-Patch.git
```
If you have not used Git before, you might need to install it first. On Debian-based distributions, it can be installed with the following command:
```
sudo apt install git
```

### Setup script:
`01-Setup.sh` installs all the necessary dependencies for the other scripts and must be run first.

### PSBBN installer script:
`02-PSBBN-Installer.sh` fully automates the installation of PSBBN

- Downloads and installs the latest version of the **PSBBN Definitive English Patch** from archive.org
- Prompts for the desired size of the Music Partition
- Prompts for the desired size of the POPS Partition
- Installs [POPS] binaries (https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/Home)
- Runs [APA-Jail](#notes-on-apa-jail), creating an exFAT partition using all remaining disk space beyond the first 128 GB (up to 2 TB)

### Game installer script: 
`03-Game-Installer.sh` fully automates the installation of PS1 and PS2 games, as well as homebrew apps. Simply place your files in the `games` folder on your computer: PS2 `ISO` or `ZSO` files in the `CD`/`DVD` folders, PS1 `VCD` files in the `POPS` folder, and `ELF` or [SAS-compliant](#notes-on-save-application-system-sas) `PSU` files in the `APPS` folder.

The script will:
- Gives you a choice of [Open PS2 Loader (OPL)](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/Open-PS2-Loader) or [Neutrino](https://github.com/rickgaiser/neutrino) for the game launcher
- Synchronise the games and apps on your PC with your PS2's drive
- Create all assets
- Downloads artwork for the PSBBN Game Channel from the [PSBBN Art Database](https://github.com/CosmicScale/psbbn-art-database) or IGN if not found in the database
- Automatically contributes game artwork from IGN and reports missing artwork to the [PSBBN Art Database](https://github.com/CosmicScale/psbbn-art-database)
- Downloads cover art for PS2 games from the [OPL Manager art database](https://oplmanager.com/site/?backups) for display in [OPL](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/Open-PS2-Loader)/[NHDDL](https://github.com/pcm720/nhddl)
- Creates [BBN Launcher](https://github.com/pcm720/bbnl) partitions, making games and apps launchable from the PSBBN Game Channel
- Creates a `conf_apps.cfg` file so apps can be displayed and launched from [OPL](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/Open-PS2-Loader)

To add or delete games/apps, simply add or remove them from the `games` folder on your computer, then run the script again to synchronise. All games and apps are kept in alphabetical order, with games also grouped by series in the Game Channel on PSBBN.

By default, the `games` directory is located in the same directory where you installed the scripts. If you need to change its location, edit `03-Game-Installer.sh` and modify the `GAMES_PATH` variable. Alternatively, you can replace the `games` directory with a symbolic link that points to the storage location of your games. Another option is to create symbolic links in the `CD`, `DVD`, `POPS`, or `APPS` subdirectories, linking to the individual `ISO`, `ZSO`, `VCD`,`ELF` or `PSU` files that you wish to sync.

### General Notes:
- PSBBN requires a Fat PS2 console** with expansion bay and an official Sony Network Adapter
- I would highly recommend using a **Kaico or BitFunx IDE to SATA Upgrade Kit** and a SATA SSD. The **Kingston A400 SSDs** have been tried and tested with PSBBN and work very well. The improved random access speed over a HDD really makes a big difference to the responsiveness of the PSBBN interface.
- PS2 games must be in ISO or ZSO format. PS1 games must be in VCD format. Apps must be in the `ELF` or [SAS-compliant](#notes-on-save-application-system-sas) `PSU` format
- PSBBN startup time increases when no active internet connection is available
- If the shortcut to [OPL](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/Open-PS2-Loader)/[NHDDL](https://github.com/pcm720/nhddl) in the Navigator Menu displays the error "Game not found," remove the shortcut. You can then manually re-add it from the Game Channel
- To quit PS1 games, press `L1 + SELECT + START`
- If you are using [OPL](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/Open-PS2-Loader) as your game launcher, to quit PS2 games, press `L1 + L2 + R1 + R2 + SELECT + START` and to power off the console press `L1 + L2 + L3 + R1 + R2 + R3`
- The `root` password for Linux is `password`. There is also a `ps2` user account with the password set as `password`

### Note on Retro GEM support:
If you have a Retro GEM, I would highly recommend that you install the [Retro GEM Game ID Resetter](https://github.com/CosmicScale/Retro-GEM-GameId-Resetter) on your PS2 Memory Card. With this app, when you quit a game, the Game ID is reset, and the Retro GEM settings are returned to global.

### Notes on Launch Disc:
**Launch Disc** loads the [Retro GEM Disc Launcher](https://github.com/CosmicScale/Retro-GEM-PS2-Disc-Launcher) application.

For physical PlayStation game discs:
- Sets the Retro GEM Game ID
- Adjusts the PlayStation driver's video mode, if needed, to ensure imports play in the correct mode

For physical PlayStation 2 game discs:
- Sets the Retro GEM Game ID
- Skips the PlayStation 2 logo check, allowing MechaPwn users to launch imports and master discs

Recommended usage:
- Add a shortcut for **Launch Disc** to the **Navigator Menu** if it is not there already
- Press `SELECT` to open the **Navigator Menu**
- Insert a game disc
- Select **Launch Disc** from the menu

### Notes on OPL:
[Open PS2 Loader (OPL)](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/Open-PS2-Loader) is a 100% open source game and application loader for the PS2.
- If you selected [Open PS2 Loader (OPL)](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/Open-PS2-Loader) as your game launcher, per-game settings assigned in OPL are reflected when launching games from the PSBBN Game Channel
- If OPL freezes at startup and games fail to launch from the PSBBN Game Channel, delete any existing OPL configuration files from your PS2 Memory Cards or connected USB devices.
- To display the games list in OPL, make sure a PS2 memory card is inserted into your console, launch OPL and adjust the following settings:
1. Settings > HDD (APA) Start Mode: Off
2. Settings > BDM Start Mode: Auto
3. Settings > BDM Devices > HDD (GPT/MBR): On
4. Settings > Save Changes

### Notes on Neutrino and NHDDL:
[Neutrino](https://github.com/rickgaiser/neutrino) is a lightweight device emulator for PS2. [NHDDL](https://github.com/pcm720/nhddl) is a frontend for Neutrino.
- If you selected [Neutrino](https://github.com/rickgaiser/neutrino) as your game launcher, per-game settings assigned in [NHDDL](https://github.com/pcm720/nhddl) are reflected when launching games from the PSBBN Game Channel
- [Neutrino](https://github.com/rickgaiser/neutrino) does not support compressed `ZSO` files. If `ZSO` files are found in your `games` folder, they will be automatically decompressed to `ISO` files by the `03-Game-Installer.sh` script

### Problems Launching Games
If games still do not appear in the [OPL](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/Open-PS2-Loader)/[NHDDL](https://github.com/pcm720/nhddl) games list and fail to launch from the PSBBN Game Channel, you should try the following:

1. If you have a mod chip, disable it
2. Re-run `03-Game-Installer.sh` and select an alternative game launcher
3. Connect the PS2 HDD/SSD directly to your PC using an internal SATA connection or a different USB adapter, then re-run `02-PSBBN-Installer.sh`
4. Try using a different HDD/SSD and re-run `02-PSBBN-Installer.sh`
5. Try using a different SATA mod for your PS2

### Notes on Save Application System (SAS):

Save Application System (SAS) is a new standard for distributing homebrew applications for the PS2. Currently in beta, but already has over 20 apps available for download on the [Save Application System Apps Archive](https://ps2wiki.github.io/sas-apps-archive/). All SAS-compliant apps come packed in a `PSU` file and include icons and metadata, making it the recommended way to install homebrew on PSBBN.

### Notes on APA-Jail:

![APA-Jail Type-A2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c83dab7-f49f-4a77-b641-9f63d92c85e7)

APA-Jail, created and developed by [Berion](https://www.psx-place.com/resources/authors/berion.1431/), enables the PS2's APA partitions to coexist with an exFAT partition. This setup allows PSBBN to access the first 128 GB of the HDD/SSD directly. All remaining space on the drive is formatted as exFAT.

An application called [BBN Launcher](https://github.com/pcm720/bbnl) resides on the APA partitions, a [pre-release build of Open PS2 Loader](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/Open-PS2-Loader) and [Neutrino](https://github.com/rickgaiser/neutrino) reside on the exFAT partition, along with the PS2 games in the `ISO` or `ZSO` format.

The exFAT partition can be accessed on a PC and on the PS2 by [BBN Launcher](https://github.com/pcm720/bbnl), a [pre-release build of Open PS2 Loader](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/Open-PS2-Loader) and [Neutrino](https://github.com/rickgaiser/neutrino).

[BBN Launcher](https://github.com/pcm720/bbnl) directs [Open PS2 Loader](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/Open-PS2-Loader) or [Neutrino](https://github.com/rickgaiser/neutrino) to launch specific PS2 games.

### Warning: Creating new partitions manually on your PS2 drive (e.g., with wLaunchELF) and exceeding the 128 GB limit will cause drive corruption.

## Installing the Japanese PSBBN software

There are a number of ways this can be achieved. On a Japanese PlayStation 2 console with an **official PSBBN installation disc**, or with **Sony Utility Discs Compilation 3**.

To install via **Sony Utility Discs Compilation 3** you will need a way to boot backup discs on your console, be that a mod chip or a swap disc. If you are lucky enough to have a **SCPH-500xx** series console you can use the **MechaPwn** softmod.

### Installing with Sony Utility Discs Compilation 3

**Preparations**
1. Download the **Sony Utility Discs Compilation 3** ISO from the Internet Archive [here](https://archive.org/details/sony-utility-disc-compilation-v3).
2. **SCPH-500xx consoles only**: Patch the ISO with the [Master Disc Patcher](https://www.psx-place.com/threads/playstation-2-master-disc-patcher-for-mechapwn.36547/).
3. Burn this ISO to a writable DVD. I recommend using [ImgBurn](https://www.imgburn.com).
4. **SCPH-500xx consoles only**: MechaPwn your PS2 console with the latest release candidate, currently [MechaPwn 3.0 Release Candidate 4 (RC4)](https://github.com/MechaResearch/MechaPwn/releases/tag/3.00-rc4). It is important that you use a version of MechaPwn that does not change the **Model Name** of your console or it will break compatibility with the Kloader app, we use later in this guide. Currently the latest stable version is not compatible. More details about exactly what MechaPwn does and how to use it can be found [here](https://github.com/MechaResearch/MechaPwn).
5. Format the PS2 HDD. In wLaunchELF press the `circle` button for **FileBrowser**, then select **MISC > HddManager**. Press `R1` to open the menu and select **Format**. When done, press `triangle` to exit.
6. Launch the **Sony Utility Discs Compilation 3** DVD on your console. **SCPH-500xx consoles only:** Insert your newly burnt **Sony Utility Discs Compilation 3** DVD into the DVD drive on your PS2 console. On the first screen of wLaunchELF, press the `circle` button for **FileBrowser**, then select **MISC > PS2Disc**. The DVD will launch. On all other model consoles, launch the **Sony Utility Discs Compilation 3** DVD any way you can (e.g. Mod chip/Swap disc).
7. After the disc loads, select **HDD Utility Discs > PlayStation BB Navigator Version 0.32** from the menu to begin the installation.

**Installation**  
There's an excellent guide [here](https://bungiefan.tripod.com/psbbninstall_01.html) that talks you through the Japanese install. Because we have already formatted the hard drive, during the install you will be presented with a [different screen](https://bungiefan.tripod.com/psbbninstall_02.html). It's important that you select the 3rd install option. This will install PSBBN without re-formatting the HDD. When the install is complete you will be instructed to remove the DVD, do so but also remove your Free McBoot Memory Card, before pressing the `circle` button.

**Network Settings**  
You will be asked to enter your network settings. Make sure your Ethernet cable is connected. Everything is still in Japanese, but it's relatively straightforward:
1. Press the `circle` button on the first screen.
2. On the next screen, select the **bottom** option, "Do not use PPPoE" and press `circle`.
3. On the next screen, select the **top** option, “Auto" for you IP address and press `circle`.
4. On the next screen, select the **top** option, “Auto” for DNS settings and press `circle`.
5. Press `right` on the d-pad to proceed to the next screen.
6. Select the **bottom** option, "Do not change router settings" and press `circle`.
7. Finally, press `circle` again to confirm your settings.

For your efforts you will be given a DNAS error. This is to be expected. We'll fix that next. Press `X` and feel free to explore your fresh install of the Japanese PSBBN.

**Disable DNAS Authentication**  
1. Turn off the console and put your Free McBoot Memory Card back into a memory card slot.  
2. Turn the console on and load wLaunchELF.  
3. Go to **FileBrowser**. Navigate to `hdd0:/__contents/bn.conf/` and delete the file `default_isp.dat`. This will disable the DNAS checks.

**Please Note**
Before installing the English patch, you **must** power off your console to standby mode by holding the reset button. Failure to do so will cause issues with Kloader.

## Notes
- Use OPL-Launcher to launch PS2 games from the Game Channel. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/OPL-Launcher).
- Lacks support for large HDDs so drives larger than 130 GB cannot be taken full advantage of. PSBBN can only see the first 130,999 MB of data on your HDD/SSD (as reported by wLaunchELF). If there is 131,000 MB or more on your HDD/SSD, PSBBN will fail to launch. Delete data so there is less than 131,000 MB used, and PSBBN will launch again. In that space, I've managed to install 40 PS2 games in the ZSO format, 9 PS1 games, all bootable from the Game Channel, plus 3 homebrew apps, and Linux. Be extra careful if you have installed via the [PS2 HDD RAW Image](#ps2-hdd-raw-image-install) on a drive larger than 120 GB, going over 130,999 MB will corrupt the drive.
- You might need to manually change the title of your "Favorite" folders if they were created before you [Patched an existing PSBBN install](#patch-an-existing-psbbn-install).

## Known Issues/Limitations of PSBBN
PSBBN only supports dates up to the end of 2030. When setting the time and date, the year must be set to 2030 or below.  
PSBBN will freeze when launching apps if a mod chip is detected. To use PSBBN, mod chips must be disabled.  
PSBBN will freeze at the "PlayStation 2" logo when booting if a 3rd party, unofficial HDD adapter is used. An official Sony Network Adapter is required.  
\* Instances in feega where some Japanese text could not be translated because it is hard coded in an encrypted file. Atok software has not been translated.  
\** Should also be compatible with the PS2 Slim SCPH-70xxx models with an IDE Resurrector or similar mod. [PSBBN Definitive English Patch 2.0](#new-to-version-20) and older versions of the [PS2 HDD RAW Image Install](#ps2-hdd-raw-image-install) are not compatible with early model Japanese PS2 consoles that have an external HDD due to space limitations (unless the stock drive is replaced with a 200+ GB drive). When [Patching an existing PSBBN install](#patch-an-existing-psbbn-install), Kloader might have compatibility issues with early model Japanese PS2 consoles with an external HDD.  
\***Default on-screen keyboard is Japanese. US English on-screen keyboard has been added, but you have to press `SELECT` a number of times to access it. I've noticed a bug where the spacebar key does not function on the US English on-screen keyboard. A space can be entered by pressing the triangle button on the controller instead. I could revert back to the Japanese qwerty keyboard in the future, but I think the benefits of the US keyboard outweigh this negative.
